LiveCompositor is an open-source media server for real-time, low-latency, programmable video and audio mixing.

LiveCompositor targets real-time use cases, with a significant focus on situations where latency is critical. It is a great fit
for any video conferencing, live-streaming, or broadcasting solutions where you need to combine or modify video on the fly.
However, you can also use it for non-real-time use cases, for example, apply some effect on a video from an MP4 file and write the output
to the new MP4.

We don't have plans to introduce any major breaking changes in the API in the foreseeable future.

## Where to start?

Check out our [`Getting started`](https://compositor.live/docs/intro) section.

LiveCompositor supports Linux and macOS and can be used in 2 ways:

- Standalone media server - [`compositor.live/docs`](https://compositor.live/docs/intro).
- Element in a Membrane Framework pipeline - [github.com/weaversam8/membrane_live_compositor_plugin](https://github.com/weaversam8/membrane_live_compositor_plugin).
